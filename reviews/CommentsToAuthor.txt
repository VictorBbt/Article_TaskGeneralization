Comments to author (Associate Editor)
=====================================

The paper presents a framework for learning and reproducing
tasks from human demonstrations using robots. While it
offers promising results in simulation, it would benefit
from clarification regarding its real-world applicability
and a more explicit statement of its unique contributions
compared to existing work. In particular the authors are
encouraged to address the following:

- The paper should clarify why the JVRC1 Robot was used in
simulation and its relevance to real-world applications
with the HRP-4C Robot.

- The authors should state more explicitly the paper's
primary contributions to distinguish it from related
research.

- Address the gap between simulation and real-world
performance and discuss plans for improvement.

- Provide a clear rationale for the selection of task
features, especially the choice of the x-axis position.

- Ensure clarity in figures and explanations, addressing
reviewer concerns.
