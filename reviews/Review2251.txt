Reviewer 9 of SII 2024 submission 288

Comments to the author
======================

In this paper, the authors propose a complete framework for
learning and reproducing tasks from human demonstrations.
The authors reproduce and extend the acquired multistep
task using Dynamic Movement Primitives in simulation for
the JVRC1 Robot, and further validate it in the real world
with the HRP-4C Robot.

The comments and questions are listed as follows:

(1) What is the purpose of the simulation for the JVRC1
Robot, are there any relationship with the real world
application with the HRP-4C Robot

(2) What is the main contribution of the proposed framework

(3) What is the successful rate of the real task, and how
to improve the successful rate in the future work


Comments on the Video Attachment
================================

It is a nice video, maybe more real application would be
fine.
