Comments to the author
======================

The paper present the system integration for HRI, including
learning from demonstration and segmenting tasks. The
integration appears good, from gathering data, to 
extracting features (with synched sensors), and segmenting
them. The results are also promising (though a bit low
performance).  What is really missing from the paper, is a
statement of what is new and different compared to other
works out there that try to solve the same problem.
Overall, a good paper.

Comments on the Video Attachment
================================

I was not able to play the video on Ubuntu, but when I used
my Mac it appeared OK, but a bit of low resolution quality.
