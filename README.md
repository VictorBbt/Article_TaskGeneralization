# Article about Task Learning and generalization for humanoid robots

This repository contains the pdf version and the video attachment of the paper I co-authored with my tutor **Prof. Fumio Kanehiro**  during my 6-month research internship at the **Joint Robotics Laboratory** in Tsukuba, Japan.

This article was accepted and will be published at the **SII2024** conference that will take place in early January, 2024.
